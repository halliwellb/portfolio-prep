Materials gathering for my software-developer portfolio; pictures, professional pitch, etc.


1.	A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

**Tech for Biodiversity**

2.	A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

**Techie passionately focused on promoting biodiversity and conservation.**

3.	Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

**My name is Ben Halliwell. I’m a native Mainer, USMC veteran, Software Developer, and I’m most excited about the ways that tech can have a positive impact on the natural world. Growing up in Maine, I inherited a strong respect for our wildlife and environment. This deepened during my time in the Marine Corps. I’ve seen firsthand how nature is sometimes revered, and sometimes abused.
I work hard to find the positives in a situation, no matter how hard that is, and I believe that technology has opened an unparalleled opportunity for us to reconnect with nature and uncover the importance of nature for nature’s sake. This might sound contradictory, but at no time in human history have we humans been so well off that we can truly return some of what we’ve taken, back to nature. We have technology to thank for that! 
As a software developer, I’m very excited to simplify and enhance our ability to connect with nature. I believe that the VR technology available today can offer an extraordinary opportunity to genuinely connect anyone in the world with any part of its natural wonders, and that this is the first step to enhancing our individual environments.**
